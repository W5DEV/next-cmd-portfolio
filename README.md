# Whiskey 5 Development Terminal

The Whiskey 5 Development Terminal is a new iteration of my personal portfolio, and is currently a WIP as I flesh out new features to add to show off my skills. 

This terminal clone uses NextJS and Typescript, along with Tailwind CSS.

## Development Roadmap
<ul>
  <li>Fix caret to match caret in iTerm</li>
  <li>Add additional commands to showcase non-development related hobbies and resources</li>
  <li>Secure domain name, add new favicon and title/description</li>
</ul>
