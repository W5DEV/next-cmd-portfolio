# Terminal-style Development Portfolio

The decision to redo my development portfolio was a no-brainer once this idea came to me. Based loosely on terminals found out in the wild (think Windows Command Prompt, MacOS Terminal, iTerm, etc),I wanted my portfolio to not only feature my skills and projects, but provide a fun way for visitors to explore my development experience while also discovering clever Easter eggs along the way. I developed this portfolio using Next.js and Tailwind CSS - two frameworks I reach for the most when developing websites and web applications.

I took visual inspiration from a few existing implementations of this, however, since none of the projects were using Next.js nor Tailwind CSS, I knew this would be a good project to not only showcase my skills in both frameworks, but create something that showcased not only my development projects and experiences, but also a bit of my personal character as well. 

This terminal clone uses NextJS and Typescript, along with Tailwind CSS.

## Development Roadmap
<ul>
  <li>Fix caret to match caret in iTerm</li>
  <li>Add additional commands to showcase non-development related hobbies and resources</li>
</ul>
